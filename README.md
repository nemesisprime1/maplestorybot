## 📚 FAQs 📚
- **Not a AHK bot**

**Q**: How does it work?
**A**: Bot is fully external, no memory reads, no injections, no hooks to the game. Works by taking screenshot and pressing your keyboard.

**Q**: What happens when there's a game update?  
**A**: Since our bot doesn't interact with the game files, it won't be affected by game updates.

**Q**: Can I run the bot on more than one PC?  
**A**: Indeed! You're free to use the bot across multiple PCs, but not simultaneously on different systems. If interested in multi-PC usage at the same time, please highlight this when creating a ticket at get-started. We're here to assist!

**Q**: Does it work for XYZ Server?  
**A**: Currently tested servers are: KMS, MSEA, JMS, and should work on all private servers with 5th job update
