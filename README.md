## ðŸ“š FAQs ðŸ“š
- **Not a AHK bot**

**Q**: Will the bot get detected?  
**A**: Absolutely not! Our bot is undetectable to MapleStory's anticheat system, with no lie detectors or spinning runes!

**Q**: What happens when there's a game update?  
**A**: Sit back and relax. Since our bot doesn't interact with the game files, it won't be affected by game updates.

**Q**: Can I run the bot on more than one PC?  
**A**: Indeed! You're free to use the bot across multiple PCs, but not simultaneously on different systems. If interested in multi-PC usage at the same time, please highlight this when creating a ticket at get-started. We're here to assist!

**Q**: Does it work for XYZ Server?  
**A**: Currently tested servers are: MSEA, GMS, KMS, JMS, YeonHwa, Eluna, Aries
